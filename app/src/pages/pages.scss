// ./styles/pages.scss

// This file is now much cleaner.
// It should only contain styles that are SPECIFIC to the landing page layout itself.
// Since our layout is very simple, it might even be empty for now, which is perfectly fine.

// For example, if you wanted to add a unique background to just this page's <main> area:
.landing-page main {
    // background-color: #f0f2f5; // example
}
